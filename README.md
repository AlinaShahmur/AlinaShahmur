## My Story ##
I graduated from Novosibirsk State Technical University. I have a bachelor's degree in Applied computer science in economics.I moved to Israel in 2018. When I moved to Israel I decided that first of all I need to learn the Hebrew language. After 2 years of my residence in Israel I started to learn Web development independently and when I realized that I would like to develop in this sphere I took the full stack web development frontal course in Technion continuing education.
I have built some own independent projects and within the course. You can get to know with some of them on my GitHub profile and on my Web site portfolio.  
Currently I work in software development company and I am engaged in backend web development on stack nodeJs,MongoDb.
