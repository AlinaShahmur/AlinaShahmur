## About me ##

Hi! My name is Alina and I am Frontend Developer. I am passionate about web development and new technologies.

## My Story ##
I graduated from Novosibirsk State Technical University. I have a bachelor's degree in Applied computer science in economics.Now I live in Israel. When I moved to Israel I decided that first of all I need to learn the Hebrew language due to feel undependent in the country. After 2 years of my residence in Israel I started to learn Web development independently and when I realized that I would like to develop in this sphere I took the full stack web development frontal course in Technion continuing education.
I have built some independent projects and within the course. You can get to know with some of them on my GitHub profile and on my Web site portfolio.

My specialization is frontend development, but in general I also familiar with server-side technologies and principles of work
